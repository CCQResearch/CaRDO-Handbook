# Example Datasets

Below are three example datasets that can be used for exploring population-level cancer statistics in CaRDO. These datasets are designed to illustrate how cancer incidence, mortality, and population data should be structured and how they will be visualised in CaRDO. 

[Cancer Incidence Dataset](data/CaRDO_Inc_Example.csv): An example dataset containing cancer *diagnoses* by cancer type, year, sex and age group.

[Cancer Mortality Dataset](data/CaRDO_Mrt_Example.csv): An example dataset containing cancer *deaths* by cancer type, year, sex and age group.

[Population Dataset](data/CaRDO_Pop_Example.csv): An example dataset containing population estimates by age group, and sex, which can be used for calculating cancer rates and standardizing comparisons over time. This dataset should correspond to the same geographic area as your cancer incidence and mortality data to ensure accurate rate calculations and comparisons.
