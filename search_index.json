[["index.html", "The CaRDO Handbook Chapter 1 About 1.1 Getting started", " The CaRDO Handbook James Retell, Sean Francis, James Rene &amp; Peter Baade Chapter 1 About CaRDO is a user-friendly R package for creating interactive R-Shiny dashboards that visualize and publish population-level cancer statistics. Designed for users with little to no R or R-Shiny experience, CaRDO provides an accessible way to visually explore and communicate detailed cancer data with just a few clicks. Click here to see an example of CaRDO in action 1.1 Getting started If youre an experienced R user with data ready to go, then get started immediately with the following steps: CaRDO requires the following packages installed before launching install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;plotly&quot;) install.packages(&quot;markdown&quot;) Download CaRDO from GitHub using devtools::install_github(&quot;https://github.com/CCQResearch/CaRDO&quot;) Load CaRDO using CaRDO::create_dashboard() Otherwise, continue reading and well walk you through creating a CaRDO dashboard step by step From the beginning. "],["from-the-beginning.html", "Chapter 2 From the beginning 2.1 R &amp; RStudio", " Chapter 2 From the beginning This document is designed to make CaRDO accessible to those with little or no R experience. For those with R and RStudio already installed and experience using R, skip ahead to {data requirements}. Dont be discouraged by the length of this document! Setting up your CaRDO dashboard is a simple and straightforward process, and this guide will walk you through it step by step. Our goal is to make it easy for you to access and visualize cancer data with confidence. 2.1 R &amp; RStudio CaRDO is an R package and requires R and RStudio to work. R and RStudio are easy to install freely available software. First download R software here and install. Being mindful to install the correct version for your computers operating system (Windows, Mac etc.) Once R is installed, download the free version of RStudio here and install. Open RStudio to confirm that it works. Note, if you are working within an organisation, you may need to contact your IT team to install R and RStudio. Base R is not very user-friendly, and we wont use it again here. However, it is necessary for working in RStudio. Think of RStudio as a program like Microsoft Word  but instead of helping you write in English, it helps you write in R. RStudio is far more user-friendly, and we will use it to build your CaRDO dashboard. Note: R is case sensitive. Code detailed here should be copied into RStudio exactly as it appears. For readers wishing to learn more about R and RStudio, detailed learning material  well beyond what is required for CaRDO  is available here. Well jump out of RStudio for a moment and in the next section discuss the data required to build a CaRDO dashboard. "],["data-requirements.html", "Chapter 3 Data Requirements 3.1 Data privacy 3.2 The basic dashboard 3.3 Other data details to note", " Chapter 3 Data Requirements 3.1 Data privacy Important. Data loaded into CaRDO is stored locally on your computer, and all analyses are performed locally. Your data will not leave your computer while using CaRDO  CaRDO has been designed with data privacy as a top priority. However, if you choose to publish your dashboard (e.g., share it online), data will be uploaded to the cloud at the resolution that it appears in the dashboard. It is your responsibility to ensure that all displayed data is appropriate for sharing before publishing publicly. 3.2 The basic dashboard The type of CaRDO dashboard youre able to create will depend on the breadth of data you have available. The simplest dashboard available is a display of cancer incidence statistics, and the data necessary to generate this minimum dashboard are listed below. Cancer type Counts (number of diagnoses) Diagnosis year Age at diagnosis @ref(tab:5-year age groups)5-year age groups Sex Note: The specific names of these variables in your dataset do not matter, only that these data are available. More expansive dashboards are possible where additional variables are available, and we will cover those options shortly. But first, there are three key requirements for any cancer dataset that is loaded into CaRDO. 3.2.1 Data structure Your data must be in the following structure (variable names do not matter) Cancer Count Year Age.group Sex Liver 25 2018 12 1 Breast 52 2003 15 2 Colorectal 28 2007 9 2 Prostate 51 2019 9 1 Breast 11 2019 6 2 You must have a single column for each variable and outcome you wish to report, and each row in your dataset should correspond to a unique combination of each variable. Full example datasets are available {here} 3.2.2 Cancer types Cancer-type values must be coded as you wish them to be displayed (see example above). For example, breast cancer should be coded as Breast cancer or Breast and not as a numerical value. Numerical coding will cause cancer types to display as numbers in the dashboard and be uninterpretable for users who dont know the coding scheme. 3.2.3 5-year age groups Cancer counts must be aggregated by 5-year age groups, with age groups coded numerically from 118. 5-year age groups are necessary for two reasons. Firstly, a standard format is required for CanDOR to aggregate data and display cancer counts by broad age groups. Secondly, where age-standardized rates are being calculated, 5-year age groups are required. Age.group Age.group.numeric 0-4 1 5-9 2 10-14 3 15-19 4 20-24 5 25-29 6 30-34 7 35-39 8 40-44 9 45-49 10 50-54 11 55-59 12 60-64 13 65-69 14 70-74 15 75-79 16 80-84 17 85+ 18 Note, counts by 5-year age groups will NOT be displayed visually in the dashboard and will not be published online. CaRDO will only display and publish counts by the following broad age-groups. Broad.age.group 0 &lt;U+2013&gt; 34 35 &lt;U+2013&gt; 49 50 &lt;U+2013&gt; 64 65+ 3.3 Other data details to note It does not matter how sex is coded  youll be asked to define sex when loading your datasets. CanDOR will calculate counts for persons based on counts for males and females  you do not need to supply data for persons. By default, counts below 5 will be suppressed. These data points will appear as insufficient data in the dashboard. You will have the option to set a custom suppression threshold. Where low counts can be reverse engineered by comparing counts across conditions, all related counts will be suppressed. For example, if thyroid cancer counts for men for a given year are below 5, but counts for women are available, both mens and total (persons) will be suppressed, as the mens count could be deduced by subtracting women from the total. You will be asked to specify if you have an all cancers category in your dataset. We strongly recommend including an all cancers category in your dataset. If you do not have an all cancers category, one will be created for you based on aggregating over the cancer categories you supply. If your data is not exhaustive with respect to cancer categories, the all cancers category may (will) be misleading. Furthermore, if you have nested cancer type categories in your dataset, for example Gynecological and Ovarian cancer, you must have an all cancers category. Otherwise, cancer data will be double counted when aggregating across nested categories. All right, if your dataset looks like the example above, and you have no additional data you wish to report, then you are ready to create your dashboard and you can skip ahead to Build Your Dashboard. If you have additional data to include in your dashboard, stick with us for just a moment longer and in the next section well walk you through Expanding your dashboard. "],["expanding-your-dashboard.html", "Chapter 4 Expanding Your Dashboard 4.1 Cancer mortality data 4.2 Age-standardised rates  population data 4.3 Other data details to note", " Chapter 4 Expanding Your Dashboard 4.1 Cancer mortality data If you have cancer mortality data, CaRDO will add a mortality statistics page to your dashboard. The data requirements and processes for loading cancer mortality data are identical to those weve described for cancer incidence data. You must have a single column for each variable and outcome you wish to report, and each row in your dataset should correspond to a unique combination of each variable. Cancer-type values must be coded as you wish them to be displayed Cancer deaths must be aggregated by 5-year age groups, with age groups coded numerically from 1  18. The interface will ask you to load in a cancer incidence and mortality file separately. However, whether you store mortality data in a separate data file, or as an additional column in your incidence data file (and load the file twice) does not matter. 4.2 Age-standardised rates  population data If you wish to report age-standardised cancer rates, you must provide a population file that corresponds to your registry or organisations catchment area. Population data should be organised by year, 5-year age groups and sex, and otherwise be structured the same as your incidence data. See the example below (variable names do not matter). Year Sex Age.group Population 2003 2 1 6332 2004 1 1 7541 2005 2 3 8544 2006 2 6 9198 2007 1 11 12632 CaRDO will calculate age-standardised rates using a standard population that you will specify from a list of options. If your preferred standard population is not available, you will have the option to load your own. 4.3 Other data details to note As with incidence and mortality, it is not necessary that your population file contains population data for persons (sex = 3). Rates will be suppressed where low count data has been suppressed. "],["example-datasets.html", "Chapter 5 Example Datasets", " Chapter 5 Example Datasets Below are three example datasets that can be used for exploring population-level cancer statistics in CaRDO. These datasets are designed to illustrate how cancer incidence, mortality, and population data should be structured and how they will be visualised in CaRDO. Cancer Incidence Dataset: An example dataset containing cancer diagnoses by cancer type, year, sex and age group. Cancer Mortality Dataset: An example dataset containing cancer deaths by cancer type, year, sex and age group. Population Dataset: An example dataset containing population estimates by age group, and sex, which can be used for calculating cancer rates and standardizing comparisons over time. This dataset should correspond to the same geographic area as the cancer incidence and mortality datasets to ensure accurate rate calculations and comparisons. Please note that these datasets are fictional and do not represent real cancer data. "],["build-your-dashboard.html", "Chapter 6 Build Your Dashboard", " Chapter 6 Build Your Dashboard If youve made it this far, well done! Youre now ready to create a CaRDO dashboard. Step 1. Open RStudio Step 2. Set your working directory (optional) This is where you want to save your CaRDO dashboard application. You can set your working directory by typing the following command into the RStudio console  specifying your directory between the quotations. setwd(\"/path/to/my/directory\") Alternatively, you can set the working directory using RStudios menu system Step 3. Install the required R packages. CaRDO relies on a few essential R packages that are not included with the CaRDO package to function properly. The required packages are: DevTools Tidyverse Plotly Markdown (If you already have these packages installed, skip to step 4) To install packages, you can run the following R code Open the file and highlight the code using Ctrl + A, then click the Run button at the top right, or press Ctrl + Enter. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the following code into your RStudio console. install.packages(\"devtools\") install.packages(\"tidyverse\") install.packages(\"plotly\") install.packages(\"markdown\") Step 4 Download and install CaRDO Paste the following code into your RStudio console. devtools::install_github(\"https://github.com/CCQResearch/CaRDO\") Step 5 Create your dashboard Run CaRDO by pasting the following command into the RStudio console CaRDO::create_dashboard() Step 6. Follow the prompts and build you dashboard Load your data Specify your variables Personalise your dashboard Step 7. Run your dashboard application Once youve finished the setup, CaRDO will provide you with a file path (your R working directory) to your dashboard application. Follow the path and open the app file - this is your CaRDO application! Run the R code by clicking Run App in the top right. Youve done it! Start exploring your data by cycling through the available filters. If you run into any problems, or have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at statistics@cancerqld.org.au. In the next section well guide you through Publishing your CaRDO dashboard. "],["publishing.html", "Chapter 7 Publishing", " Chapter 7 Publishing Once you have created a dashboard, you will need to decide how to publish it to allow users to access your dashboard and explore cancer patterns and trends. There are several options available, however, we recommend using shinyapps.io. ShinyApps.io is a cloud-based hosting platform by Posit that allows users to easily deploy (within R) and share Shiny applications online without requiring server management. It offers multiple pricing tiers, including a free option, making it an accessible choice for individuals and small organizations. ShinyApps.io does have security limitations that you should be aware of - ShinyApps.io applications are run in a shared environment. This means that data flows outside of your infrastructure to reach the platform. For this reason, we do not recommend Shinyapps.io for highly sensitive data. This is why we stress confirming that your data is fit for public consumption before publishing your dashboard, and why CaRDO is specifically designed to handle sensitive data locally, before it is published. Cancer Council Queensland uses ShinyApps.io to publish our cancer statistics dashboard. A detailed summary of alternative publishing options and their strengths and limitations is available here "],["methods.html", "Chapter 8 Methods 8.1 Age-standardized rates 8.2 Lifetime risk 8.3 Incidence &amp; mortality trends", " Chapter 8 Methods 8.1 Age-standardized rates Age-standardised rates attempt to adjust for variation in age structures in different populations (either different geographical areas or the same population across time). There are two methods of age-standardisation  direct and indirect. All cancer diagnoses and cancer deaths trends were calculated using directly standardised rates. The method involves applying age-specific rates from the population of interest (i.e. your catchment) to a standard population, which in CaRDO is the World Standard Population by default [1]. Five-year age groups up to 85-years-and-above were used for all age-standardized rate calculations. 8.2 Lifetime risk Cumulative risk is a measure used to estimate the risk of developing or dying of cancer up to a specific age. It takes into account the removal of persons from the population of interest who have already been diagnosed with or died from cancer. Commonly expressed as a 1 in n proportion, the cumulative risk is calculated as: \\[n = \\frac{1}{1-\\exp(-5\\sum a_j\\times\\frac{100}{100000})}\\] where aj are the age-specific rates (5-year age groups) per 100,000 for ages 0  to your specific age group, for example 85. CaRDO provides the cumulative risk up to the age 85 as an approximation of lifetime risk. An x in 100 variation is also supplied, calculated as the inverse of the cumulative risk multiplied by 100. These calculations assume that the person experiences the current age-specific risk rates up to the age specified (e.g. 85), so do not account for any specific risk factors (such as smoking). 8.3 Incidence &amp; mortality trends This is not complete. We need to detail how trends are calculated and what packages are used etc. "],["references.html", "Chapter 9 References", " Chapter 9 References References World (WHO 2000-2025) Standard - Standard Populations - SEER Datasets "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
