[["index.html", "The CaRDO Handbook Chapter 1 About", " The CaRDO Handbook James Retell, Sean Francis, James Rene &amp; Peter Baade Chapter 1 About Cancer Registry Data Online Welcome to CaRDO. CaRDO is a user-friendly R package for creating interactive R-Shiny dashboards that visualize and publish population-level cancer statistics. Designed for users with little to no R or R-Shiny experience, CaRDO provides an accessible way to visually explore and communicate detailed cancer data with just a few clicks, all while maintaining strict data privacy. Click here to see an example dashboard created with CaRDO Get started "],["get-started.html", "Chapter 2 Get Started 2.1 R &amp; RStudio", " Chapter 2 Get Started This Handbook is a detailed guide to building your own CaRDO dashboard. Setting up your CaRDO dashboard is a simple and straightforward process, and this guide will walk you through it step by step. Our goal is to make it easy for you to visualize and publish your cancer data with confidence. CaRDO is an R package and requires R and RStudio to work. If you’re new to these software, don’t stress, we walk you through installation and setup of these software below. If you already have R and RStudio installed, jump ahead to Data Requirements. If you prefer learning by doing and only referring to manuals as a last resort, you can follow the no-frills Quick Setup. However, we don’t recommend this approach for anyone new to R and data structuring. 2.1 R &amp; RStudio R and RStudio are easy to install freely available software. First download R software here and install. Being mindful to download the correct version for your computer’s operating system (Windows, Mac etc.). Once downloaded, run the R executable file and accept the default (recommended) installation options. Once R is installed, download the free version of RStudio here and install. Open RStudio to confirm that it works. Note, if you are working within an organisation, you may need to contact your IT team to install both R and RStudio. What are these software? Base R is not very user-friendly, and we won’t use it again here. However, it is necessary for RStudio to work. Think of RStudio as a program like Microsoft Word – but instead of helping you write in English, it helps you write in R. RStudio is far more user-friendly, and we will use it to build your CaRDO dashboard. Note: R and RStudio are case sensitive. Any code detailed here should be copied into RStudio exactly as it appears here. For readers wishing to learn more about R and RStudio, detailed learning material – well beyond what is required for CaRDO – is available here. We’ll jump out of RStudio for the moment and in the next section discuss Data Requirements to build a CaRDO dashboard. Data Requirements "],["data-requirements.html", "Chapter 3 Data Requirements 3.1 The basic dashboard 3.2 Other data details to note", " Chapter 3 Data Requirements Important: Data loaded into CaRDO is stored locally on your computer, and all analyses are performed locally. Your data will not leave your computer while using CaRDO. However, if you choose to publish your dashboard (e.g., share it online), data will be uploaded to the cloud at the resolution that it appears in the dashboard. It is your responsibility to ensure that all displayed data is appropriate for sharing before publishing publicly. See data privacy for more details. 3.1 The basic dashboard The type of CaRDO dashboard you’re able to create will depend on the breadth of data you have available. The simplest dashboard available is a display of cancer incidence statistics, and the data necessary to generate this minimum dashboard are listed below. Cancer type Counts (number of diagnoses) Diagnosis year Age at diagnosis (5-year age groups) Sex Note: The specific names of these variables in your dataset do not matter, only that these data are available. More expansive dashboards are possible where additional variables are available, and we cover those options in Expand Your Dashboard. But first, there are three key requirements for all cancer datasets loaded into CaRDO. 3.1.1 Data structure Your data must be in the following structure (variable names do not matter) Cancer Count Year Age.group Sex Liver 25 2018 12 1 Breast 52 2003 15 2 Colorectal 28 2007 9 2 Prostate 51 2019 9 1 Breast 11 2019 6 2 You must have a single column for each variable and outcome you wish to report, and each row in your dataset should correspond to a unique combination of each variable. Click here for full Example Datasets 3.1.2 Cancer types Cancer-type values must be coded as you wish them to be displayed (see example above). For example, breast cancer should be coded as ‘Breast’ or ‘Breast cancer’ and not as a numerical value. Numerical coding will cause cancer types to display as numbers in the dashboard and be uninterpretable for users who don’t know the coding scheme. 3.1.3 5-year age groups Cancer counts must be aggregated by 5-year age groups, with age groups coded numerically from 1–18. Age.group Age.group.numeric 0-4 1 5-9 2 10-14 3 15-19 4 20-24 5 25-29 6 30-34 7 35-39 8 40-44 9 45-49 10 50-54 11 55-59 12 60-64 13 65-69 14 70-74 15 75-79 16 80-84 17 85+ 18 5-year age groups are necessary for two reasons. Firstly, a standard format is required for CaRDO to aggregate data and display cancer counts by broad age groups. Secondly, where age-standardized rates are being calculated, 5-year age groups are required. Note, counts by 5-year age groups will NOT be displayed visually in the dashboard and will not be published online. CaRDO will only display and publish counts by the following broad age-groups. Broad.age.group 0-34 35-49 50-64 65+ 3.2 Other data details to note It does not matter how sex is coded – you’ll be asked to define sex when loading your datasets. CaRDO will calculate counts for persons based on counts for males and females – you do not need to supply data for persons (males + females). By default, counts below 5 will be suppressed. These data points will appear as ‘insufficient data’ in the dashboard. You will have the option to set a custom suppression threshold. Where low counts can be reverse engineered by comparing counts across conditions, all related counts will be suppressed. For example, if thyroid cancer counts for men for a given year are below 5, but counts for women are available, both men’s and total (persons) will be suppressed, as the men’s count could be deduced by subtracting women from the total. You will be asked to specify if you have an ‘all cancers’ category in your dataset. We strongly recommend including an ‘all cancers’ category in your dataset. If you do not have an ‘all cancers’ category, one will be created for you based on aggregating over the cancer categories you supply. If your data is not exhaustive with respect to cancer categories, the ‘all cancers’ category may (will) be misleading. Furthermore, if you have nested cancer type categories in your dataset, for example ‘Gynecological’ and ‘Ovarian’ cancer, you must have an ‘all cancers’ category. Otherwise, cancer data will be double counted when aggregating across nested categories. If you have additional data to include in your dashboard, stick with us for just a moment longer—we’ll walk you through how to Expand Your Dashboard in the next section. Otherwise, if your dataset looks like the example above and you have no further data to add, then you’re ready to Build Your Dashboard! Expand Your Dashboard Build Your Dashboard "],["expand-your-dashboard.html", "Chapter 4 Expand Your Dashboard 4.1 Cancer mortality data 4.2 Age-standardised rates – population data 4.3 Other data details to note", " Chapter 4 Expand Your Dashboard 4.1 Cancer mortality data If you have cancer mortality data, CaRDO will add a mortality statistics page to your dashboard. The data requirements and processes for loading cancer mortality data are identical to those we’ve described for cancer incidence data. You must have a single column for each variable and outcome you wish to report, and each row in your dataset should correspond to a unique combination of each variable. Cancer-type values must be coded as you wish them to be displayed Cancer deaths must be aggregated by 5-year age groups, with age groups coded numerically from 1 – 18. The interface will ask you to load in a cancer incidence and mortality file separately. However, whether you store mortality data in a separate data file, or as an additional column in your incidence data file (and load the file twice) does not matter. 4.2 Age-standardised rates – population data If you wish to report age-standardised cancer rates, you must provide a population file that corresponds to your registry or organisation’s catchment area. Population data should be organised by year, 5-year age groups and sex, and otherwise be structured the same as your incidence data. See example below (variable names do not matter). Year Sex Age.group Population 2003 2 1 6332 2004 1 1 7541 2005 2 3 8544 2006 2 6 9198 2007 1 11 12632 4.3 Other data details to note CaRDO will calculate age-standardised rates using a standard population that you will specify from a list of options. The default standard population is the World Standard Population As with incidence and mortality, it is not necessary that your population file contains population data for persons. Rates will be suppressed where low count data has been suppressed. Now you have everything ready to Build Your Dashboard Build Your Dashboard "],["build-your-dashboard.html", "Chapter 5 Build Your Dashboard", " Chapter 5 Build Your Dashboard If you’ve made it this far, well done! You’re now ready to create a CaRDO dashboard. Step 1. Open RStudio Step 2. Set your working directory (optional) This is where you want to save your CaRDO dashboard application. You can set your working directory by typing the following command into the RStudio console – specifying your directory between the quotations. For data security reasons, we recommend setting your R working directory to a local drive that is not synced to a cloud service. This precaution helps prevent any (very unlikely) data exposure or loss. setwd(&quot;/path/to/my/directory&quot;)` Alternatively, you can set the working directory using RStudio’s menu system. Step 3. Install the required R packages. CaRDO relies on a few essential R packages that are not included with the CaRDO package to function properly. The required packages are: DevTools Tidyverse Plotly Markdown (If you already have these packages installed, skip to step 4) To install packages, copy and paste the following code into your RStudio console. install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) install.packages(&quot;plotly&quot;) install.packages(&quot;markdown&quot;) Step 4 Download and install CaRDO Paste the following code into your RStudio console. devtools::install_github(&quot;https://github.com/CCQResearch/CaRDO&quot;) Step 5 Create your dashboard Run CaRDO by pasting the following command into the RStudio console CaRDO::create_dashboard() Step 6. Follow the prompts and build your dashboard Load your data Specify your variables Personalise your dashboard Step 7. Run your dashboard application Once you’ve finished the setup, CaRDO will provide you with a local file path (your R working directory) to your dashboard application. Follow the path and open the ‘app’ file - this is your CaRDO application. Run the R code by clicking ‘Run’ in the top right. You’ve done it! Start exploring your data by cycling through the available filters. If you ran into any problems, or have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at statistics@cancerqld.org.au. In the next section we’ll guide you through Publishing your CaRDO dashboard. Note: RStudio may issue a warning if you do not have RTools installed. The warning can be dismissed in this instance - RTools is not required for CaRDO. Publishing "],["publishing.html", "Chapter 6 Publishing 6.1 Publishing with Shinyapps.io", " Chapter 6 Publishing Once you have created a dashboard, you will need to decide how to publish it to allow users to access your dashboard and explore cancer patterns and trends. There are several options available, however, we recommend using shinyapps.io. ShinyApps.io is a cloud-based hosting platform by Posit that allows users to easily deploy (within R) and share Shiny applications online without requiring server management. It offers multiple pricing tiers, including a free option, making it an accessible choice for individuals and small organizations. ShinyApps.io does have security limitations that you should be aware of - ShinyApps.io applications are run in a shared environment. This means that data flows outside of your infrastructure to reach the platform. For this reason, we do not recommend Shinyapps.io for highly sensitive data. This is why we stress confirming that your data is fit for public consumption before publishing your dashboard, and why CaRDO is specifically designed to handle sensitive data locally, before it is published. Cancer Council Queensland uses ShinyApps.io to publish our cancer statistics dashboard. A detailed summary of alternative publishing options and their strengths and limitations is available here 6.1 Publishing with Shinyapps.io A detailed guide to setting up a Shinyapps.io account and deploying your dashboard is published here. Deployment instructions are also provided upon account setup. Below we provide a summary of the key steps to follow. Step 1 - rsconnect Shinyapps.io requires the latest version of rsconnect. Install the rsconnect package by running the following command in your Rstudio console. install.packages(&#39;rsconnect&#39;) Once installed, load rsconnect into your R session. library(rsconnect) Step 2 - setup account To publish your dashboard through shinyapps.io you will need to sign up for an account. By default, all Shinyapps.io accounts are free with the option to upgrade to a paid service (more on this later). The first time you sign in, Shinyapps.io will prompt you to specify an account name. Shinyapps.io uses the account name as the domain name for all of your applications. Important: Shinyapps.io uses the account name you specify as the domain name for all your applications. Meaning, your account name will appear in the URL for your dashboard - for this reason, we recommend making your account name something relevant to your registry or organisation. Step 3 - authorize Once you have setup an account, you will need to configure the rsconnect package to authorize your account. Shinyapps.io provides instructions on how to do this once you’ve setup an account. Copy and paste the R code shown in field into your R console and run the code. Step 4 - deploy/publish You’re now ready to publish your CaRDO dashboard - there are two methods. You may run the following code, or alternatively, you may click the publish icon ( ) in the top right corner, next to run. rsconnect::deployApp(&#39;path/to/your/app&#39;) Select the files to be published: Broadly, these will include your app.R file, any other data files, and any image and css (www folder) files. The specific files required for CaRDO are the following: app.R CaRDO report template.Rmd load_data.R module.R Data www Give your dashboard a name (this will appear in the URL!) and hit Publish - this will take a moment. And you’re done. Your cancer dashboard is ready to share!

It simply requires repeating the steps outlined on the Build Your Dashboard and Publishing pages each time a new cancer extract is availbale. We recommend publishing updates to a draft / testing version to inspect for errors or inconsistencies before updating the public /primary dashboard. Once you’re comfortable with the update, republish the testing version to the public / primary dashboard. In addition to updating cancer data, be sure to update any population and or population mortality files that may require updating when new cancer data becomes available. "],["example-datasets.html", "Chapter 9 Example Datasets", " Chapter 9 Example Datasets Below are three example datasets that can be used for exploring population-level cancer statistics in CaRDO. These datasets are designed to illustrate how cancer incidence, mortality, and population data should be structured and how they will be visualised in CaRDO. Cancer Incidence Dataset: An example dataset containing cancer diagnoses by cancer type, year, sex and age group. Cancer Mortality Dataset: An example dataset containing cancer deaths by cancer type, year, sex and age group. Population Dataset: An example dataset containing population estimates by age group, and sex, which can be used for calculating cancer rates and standardizing comparisons over time. This dataset should correspond to the same geographic area as your cancer incidence and mortality data to ensure accurate rate calculations and comparisons. Please note that these datasets are fictional and do not represent real cancer data. "],["methods.html", "Chapter 10 Methods 10.1 Age-standardized rates 10.2 Lifetime risk 10.3 Incidence &amp; mortality trends 10.4 Sex specific cancers 10.5 Data Privacy", " Chapter 10 Methods 10.1 Age-standardized rates Age-standardised rates attempt to adjust for variation in age structures in different populations (either different geographical areas or the same population across time). There are two methods of age-standardisation – direct and indirect. All cancer diagnoses and cancer deaths trends were calculated using directly standardised rates. The method involves applying age-specific rates from the population of interest (i.e. your catchment) to a standard population, which in CaRDO is the World Standard Population by default [1]. Five-year age groups up to 85-years-and-above were used for all age-standardized rate calculations. 10.2 Lifetime risk Cumulative risk is a measure used to estimate the risk of developing or dying of cancer up to a specific age. It takes into account the removal of persons from the population of interest who have already been diagnosed with or died from cancer. Commonly expressed as a ‘1 in n’ proportion, the cumulative risk is calculated as: \\[n = \\frac{1}{1-\\exp(-5\\sum a_j\\times\\frac{100}{100000})}\\] where \\(a_j\\) are the age-specific rates (5-year age groups) per 100,000 for ages 0 – to your specific age group, for example 85. CaRDO provides the cumulative risk up to the age 85 as an approximation of lifetime risk. An x in 100 variation is also supplied, calculated as the inverse of the cumulative risk multiplied by 100. These calculations assume that the person experiences the current age-specific risk rates up to the age specified (e.g. 85), so do not account for any specific risk factors (such as smoking). 10.3 Incidence &amp; mortality trends Incidence and mortality trends were calculated by fitting piece-wise functions, composed of splines and linear models, to the data. Break points were identified using the strucchange package (Zeileis et al. 2002), specifically the function breakpoints() (Zeileis et al. 2003). The data was then segmented by these breakpoints. A maximum number of 3 breakpoints were set, with a minimum number of 5 observations within each segment. Then, a spline and linear model was fit to each segment using the mgcv package (Wood 2003). The model with the lowest AIC was chosen for each given segment. 10.4 Sex specific cancers CaRDO does not inherently know which cancer types are sex-specific based on the data you load. Since accurate rate calculations require matching the denominator (population count) to the appropriate sex, CaRDO determines sex specificity by scanning the dataset for sex codes by cancer type across all years. If a cancer type has data for only one sex, it is classified as sex-specific. For example, because prostate cancer occurs only in males and is absent from female data, CaRDO knows to calculate rates using the male population as the denominator rather than the total population. It is important to note that this method does not distinguish between truly sex-specific cancers and cases where data for one sex is simply absent due to low numbers. Where data is absent due to low counts, CaRDO will misclassify the cancer type as sex-specific and calculate the rate using the incorrect denominator (population count). If this unlikely scenario arises, in the short term, we recommend removing cancer types from your dataset that are not sex-specific but where data is only available for one sex. For an alternative solution, please reach out to us at statistics@cancerqld.org.au 10.5 Data Privacy Data loaded into CaRDO is stored locally on your computer, and all analyses are performed locally. Your data will not leave your computer while using CaRDO – CaRDO has been designed with data privacy as a top priority. The process of loading data into CaRDO is no different to loading data into RStudio. In fact, that is all that is happening - CaRDO loads data into the RStudio environment and carries out data processing locally on your machine. It is perfectly safe to load sensitive data into CaRDO as you would into any other data software. Once CaRDO has finished data processing, it will create a series of data files used for the creation of the dashboard. We encourage you to inspect these data files if you have any concerns. Suppression of sensitive data (low counts) is discussed in the Data Requirements section. Important: If you choose to publish your dashboard (e.g., share it online), data will be uploaded to the cloud (made public) at the resolution that it appears in the dashboard. It is your responsibility to ensure that all displayed data is appropriate for sharing before publishing publicly. "],["references.html", "Chapter 11 References", " Chapter 11 References Wood, S.
